# Cover Letter Generator

## Motivation

I build this cover letter generator to more effortlessly template out my cover letters. The one time I left a company's name in one of my cover letter templates, used that template, and sent the cover letter with one occurrence of the wrong company name, I knew I could use something like this. Also, building things in Svelte is pretty fun.

If this project has helped you through your cover letter writting journey, feel free to star this project.
